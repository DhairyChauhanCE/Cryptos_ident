   # � EXTREME EMERALD: Zero-Knowledge Identity Protocol

**Secure. Private. Irrevocable.**  
A production-grade ZK-Identity framework for privacy-preserving age-gating and nationality verification on the Polygon blockchain.

---

## 🏛️ Project Vision
Extreme Emerald solves the "Privacy Paradox" in digital verification. It allows users to prove they are over 18, have a specific nationality, or are students WITHOUT revealing their birth date, passport number, or university ID to the verifying application.

## 🚀 Judge's Fast-Track (Verification)
Judges can verify the technical integrity of this submission via the following "Zero-Mock" protocols:

### 1. On-Chain Verification
The smart contracts are deployed and verified on **Polygon Amoy**.
- **IdentityRegistry**: [Link to Polygonscan]
- **Verifier Circuits**: Groth16 SnarkVerifiers are integrated directly into the registry logic.

### 2. Zero-Knowledge Integrity
- **Local Proving**: All ZK proofs (`snarkjs`) are generated 100% client-side in the user's browser.
- **Privacy First**: No sensitive identity data (DOB, Nationality) ever leaves the user's local AES-256 encrypted vault.
- **On-Chain Revocation**: Supports administrative revocation for compliance and anti-fraud (GDPR Ready).

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **Circuits**: Circom 2.1 (Age, Nationality, Student).
- **Proofs**: Groth16 (BN128 Curve).
- **Blockchain**: Polygon Amoy Testnet.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Framer Motion (Optimized for Web3 UX).
- **Security**: AES-256 session-locked local vault.
- **HUD Engine**: Multi-stage ZK-Proving HUD with real-time progress.
- **Backend Architecture**: Express.js server for identity auditing and proof logging.
- **Admin**: On-chain revocation and registry management dashboard.
- **Full-Stack Connectivity**: Unified bridge between local ZK-circuits, blockchain, and centralized auditing.

## 🕹️ Running the Demo Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

2. **Initialize Local Node**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. **Deploy Locally**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. **Launch Interface**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

5. **Security Check**:
   Once inside, the dashboard will automatically prompt you to switch to the correct "Hardhat Local" or "Polygon Amoy" network to ensure zero-data corruption.
